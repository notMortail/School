Group 35 - Western University Mapping Software
A Short Description:
The software is an application designed to assist people with navigating the 
interior spaces of Western University buildings. The application uses the floor 
plans of all the university's buildings that are made available to the public 
to allow users to search and explore inside spaces. It provides various features
 like searching for rooms in buildings, locating points of interest in a 
building, browsing through maps provided, creating and saving personal points
 of interest. Additionally, there is an accompanying editing tool that allows
 developers to create and edit map data for their own use. The software aims 
to improve accessibility and usability of the maps for all users, not just 
those in need of accessibility features.
