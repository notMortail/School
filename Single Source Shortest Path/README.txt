This program takes in a file containing the information of a graph.
The information in this file contains adjacent vertices and the path length
between them.

The program produces an adjacency list showing all pairs of adjacent vertices.

The program then uses Dijkstra's algorithm to generate a single source
shortest path tree starting from vertex 1 to every other vertex.

To run the program, execute the following command in the command line:

	./asn3.sh < infile.txt

A capture of the output is available in "typescript.nice" which can be viewed
in notepad.
