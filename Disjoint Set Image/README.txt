This program takes in a file containing a text image.
It then identifies every disjoint set (isolated island of pixels)
and performs path compression on the resulting disjoint set trees.

To run the program execute the following command in the command line:

	./asn2.sh < face

A capture of the output has been provided in "typescript.nice" which
can be viewed in notepad.
